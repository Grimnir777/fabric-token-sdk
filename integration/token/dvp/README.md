# Delivery vs Payment 

In this section, we will address a more complex scenario.
Let us start by describing it first.
There are two parties: a `seller` and a `buyer`.
- The `seller` owns a house that she wants to sell for an amount of money corresponding
to the house's valuation.
- The `buyer` owns some cash in the form of digital tokens and wants to buy the house
the seller is offering.

This can be seen as a classical `delivery versus payment`, (DVP, for short).
